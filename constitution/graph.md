| --- | --- |
| governed-by | Points at a rule the process respects while it runs. |
| depends-on | The source is incomplete without the target, and the note names which target constraint the source relies on. |
| constrains | The source narrows where the target applies, and the note names what falls outside it. |

## Foundations

### no-fixed-cost

Every platform component is free; if it can't be, it must be consumption-based — never a flat cost.

**Violations:**

- Platform-provisioned service with a fixed monthly cost adopted.
- Applying no-fixed-cost constraints to application team.

### no-human-touch

BigBang initializes the platform. After that, code is the only path to production — proof it can always be rebuilt from scratch.

**Violations:**

- Configuration value set manually instead of sourced from the repo.
- Deployment that bypasses the branch-gated promotion flow.

### no-platform-ops

The platform grows more self-sufficient, landing zones take on more ownership, and the platform team becomes less and less necessary.

**Violations:**

- Platform team operating resources inside a landing zone on behalf of the application team.

### no-unapproved-resources

The allowed list starts empty. A resource type joins the platform only after its security controls, telemetry, and integration patterns are in place — once it is, app teams can use it freely within the boundaries Azure Policy guarantees.

**Violations:**

- Resource type added to the allowed list before Deny policies and diagnostic settings are wired.

- path: AzurePlatformVariables.environmentVariables.TOP_LEVEL_MANAGEMENT_GROUP_NAME.prod

## Regulative - entity

### application-teams-own-the-cost

A subscription must bill to the owning application's invoice section.

**Why:** Without it, attribution falls back to tags, which is less precise and requires allocation logic to run.

**Anchor:** no-fixed-cost

**Implements:** platform-member

**Violations:**

- Cost attributed through tags rather than invoice section isolation.
- Subscription billing to a shared invoice section.

**Files:**

- `githubVariables.json`
- `.github/workflows/template-new-platform-members.yml`
- `.github/workflows/template-landing-zones.yml`

### azure-native-services-only

Only services manageable through Azure Resource Manager may be adopted.

**Why:** Without an ARM resource representation, a service falls outside the platform's Policy, RBAC, and diagnostic controls.

**Anchor:** no-unapproved-resources

**Implements:** guardrail

**Files:**

- `platform-management/policy/parameters/oases/allowedResources.json`

### azure-policy-allowed-location

Azure Policy must allow only the approved location.

**Why:** Without this, the platform cannot prove that landing-zone resources stay in the single region.

**Anchor:** no-unapproved-resources

**Implements:** guardrail

**Links:**

- depends-on → deployment-config-in-repo — The allowed location comes from githubVariables.json.

**Violations:**

- Multi-region deployment treated as supported by the platform.

**Files:**

- `githubVariables.json`
- `.github/workflows/template-Azure-Policy.yml`
- `platform-management/policy/bicep/oases.bicep`

### azure-policy-allowed-resources

Azure Policy must allow only the approved resource types.

**Why:** Without an allow list, the platform cannot tell whether a misconfiguration was accidental or a deliberate choice.

**Anchor:** no-unapproved-resources

**Implements:** guardrail

**Violations:**

- Resource type added to the allowed-resources list for proof-of-concept use only.

**Files:**

- `platform-management/policy/parameters/oases/allowedResources.json`

### azure-policy-config-diagnostic-settings

Azure Policy must configure diagnostic settings for every allowed resource.

**Why:** Without this, the platform cannot guarantee a consistent telemetry flow from approved resources to the landing-zone workspace.

**Anchor:** no-unapproved-resources

**Implements:** guardrail

**Violations:**

- Diagnostic settings not configured by logs category group.

**Files:**

- `platform-management/policy/bicep/configDiagnosticSettings.bicep`
- `platform-management/policy/parameters/diagnosticSettings.bicepparam`

### azure-policy-custom-definition

An Azure Policy gap must be closed by a custom definition when built-in policies do not support the desired effect.

**Why:** Without that, new Azure resources can enter the platform with security gaps Azure policies do not close.

**Anchor:** no-unapproved-resources

**Implements:** guardrail

**Links:**

- depends-on → azure-policy-effect-declaration — The custom definition's effect determines its policy control's name prefix.

**Violations:**

- Use Audit or AuditIfNotExist mode for Azure Policies that must have more restrictive effect.

**Files:**

- `platform-management/policy/bicep/customPolicyDefinitions.bicep`
- `platform-management/policy/parameters/customDefinitions/policyDefinitions.bicepparam`
- `platform-management/policy/parameters/customDefinitions/*.json`

### azure-policy-deny-cross-tenant-data-replication

Azure Policy must deny cross-tenant data replication.

**Why:** Without this, data can leave the tenant over Microsoft's backbone without crossing a network boundary the platform can observe.

**Anchor:** no-unapproved-resources

**Implements:** guardrail

**Files:**

- `platform-management/policy/bicep/oases.bicep`
- `platform-management/policy/parameters/oases/denyCrossTenantReplication.json`

### azure-policy-deny-local-authentication

Azure Policy must deny local authentication methods such as SAS tokens, access keys, or password.

**Why:** Without this, the platform cannot guarantee that authentication flows through Entra ID and Azure RBAC.

**Anchor:** no-unapproved-resources

**Implements:** guardrail

**Violations:**

- Azure resource is approved even though it lets product teams operate outside Entra ID and RBAC.

**Files:**

- `platform-management/policy/bicep/oases.bicep`
- `platform-management/policy/parameters/oases/denyLocalAuthentication.json`

### azure-policy-deny-public-network

Azure Policy must deny public network access for every allowed resource.

**Why:** Without this, the platform can't guarantee that data plane access stays inside the landing zone network boundary.

**Anchor:** no-unapproved-resources

**Implements:** guardrail

**Links:**

- depends-on → landing-zone-github-runners — Runners inside the landing zone VNet provide data-plane access when public access is denied.

**Violations:**

- Private endpoint connectivity proposed where service endpoint access from the landing zone VNet is supported.

**Files:**

- `platform-management/policy/bicep/oases.bicep`
- `platform-management/policy/parameters/oases/denyPublicNetworkAccess.json`
- `platform-management/policy/parameters/customDefinitions/*`

### azure-policy-deny-weak-tls

An approved resource must refuse clients connecting below TLS 1.2.

**Why:** Without it, traffic to approved resources can fall back to protocol versions with known breaks, exposing data in transit.

**Anchor:** no-unapproved-resources

**Implements:** guardrail

**Violations:**

- An approved resource permits non-HTTPS transport.
- Minimum-TLS policy assigned with audit instead of deny.

**Files:**

- `platform-management/policy/bicep/oases.bicep`
- `platform-management/policy/parameters/oases/denyWeakTLS.json`

### azure-policy-effect-declaration

An Azure Policy's name must use exactly one platform prefix: deny, config, or allowed.

**Why:** Without this, landing-zone users cannot tell whether a policy modifies resources on their behalf, weakening code as the source of truth.

**Anchor:** no-unapproved-resources

**Implements:** guardrail

**Files:**

- `platform-management/policy/bicep/oases.bicep`
- `platform-management/policy/bicep/modules/assignment.bicep`

### azure-policy-reference

An exemption must resolve its assignment ID through the platform-generated reference file.

**Why:** A hardcoded assignment ID silently breaks every exemption when the platform redeploys.

**Anchor:** no-unapproved-resources

**Implements:** guardrail

**Links:**

- depends-on → azure-policy-effect-declaration — The reference file is indexed by assignment name, so the name stays stable across redeployments.

**Files:**

- `.github/workflows/lz-flow-create-policy-exemption.yml`
- `landing-zones/*/policy-assignment-reference.json`
- `.github/scripts/get-policyAssignmentsReference.ps1`

### deployment-config-in-repo

Platform configuration must be defined in the repository, never set outside it.

**Why:** BigBang destroys and recreates GitHub environments, so configuration held outside the repo cannot be reproduced.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** bigbang

**Violations:**

- Bicep parameter with a hardcoded tenant ID or location instead of readEnvironmentVariable().

**Files:**

- `githubVariables.json`

### deployment-declarative-lifecycle

A deployment stack must be configured with deleteAll, so what its code stops declaring is removed from Azure.

**Why:** Without this, resources removed from the stack's code persist in Azure and the code stops being the source of truth.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** bigbang

**Files:**

- `.github/workflows/template-landing-zones.yml`
- `.github/workflows/template-access-control.yml`
- `.github/workflows/template-Azure-Policy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/template-Management-Groups.yml`

### deployment-logic-reusable-workflow

Deployment logic must live in a reusable workflow; an environment workflow supplies inputs and nothing more.

**Why:** Without reuse, a fix to deployment logic has to be repeated in every environment workflow, and environments drift apart.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** bigbang

**Violations:**

- Deployment steps duplicated in an environment workflow instead of called from a template.

**Files:**

- `.github/workflows/template-landing-zones.yml`
- `.github/workflows/template-Azure-Policy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/template-access-control.yml`
- `.github/workflows/template-Management-Groups.yml`
- `.github/workflows/template-lz-template.yml`

### diagnostic-settings-parameter-contract

The main diagnostic initiative must define shared defaults; parameter files may override only policy-specific values.

**Why:** Without a single owner for shared defaults, diagnostic behavior can drift when parameter files repeat or replace values inconsistently.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** guardrail

**Violations:**

- A shared diagnostic default is hardcoded in a parameter file instead of the main initiative.
- A parameter file passes an outer-initiative parameter that the child policy does not declare.

**Files:**

- `platform-management/policy/bicep/configDiagnosticSettings.bicep`
- `platform-management/policy/parameters/diagnosticSettings.bicepparam`

### eval-PR-validator

The PR validator must be tested against a fixed eval set at least weekly.

**Why:** An untested graph change can silently break how a rule is interpreted, and nothing would show that until a PR is wrongly passed or wrongly failed.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** eval

**Links:**

- depends-on → validate-codebase-rules — Evals use the validator's exact prompt and verdict format.

**Violations:**

- Eval workflow not scheduled to run at least weekly.
- FAIL fixture with an empty must_fail.
- must_fail entry naming an id with no matching node in the graph.

**Files:**

- `constitution/eval/PR-validator/`
- `.github/workflows/eval-pr-validate-codebase-rules.yml`
- `.github/scripts/build-combined-eval-prompt.sh`
- `.github/scripts/check-combined-eval.sh`

### eval-semantic

A semantic eval must test a constitutive rule against its own fixture files.

**Why:** Without fixed files, the expected count drifts with the repository and a failure stops pointing at the rule.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** eval

**Violations:**

- Expected count read from the live repository.
- Semantic eval run with the full graph in context.

**Files:**

- `constitution/eval/semantic/`

### functionality-named-in-graph

Functionality the codebase carries must be named by a knowledge graph node.

**Why:** Functionality the graph doesn't name is functionality the constitution can't govern, and the graph stops describing what the code actually does.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** constitution

**Links:**

- depends-on → update-knowledge-base — Closing uncovered-functionality findings requires adding the missing graph entries.

**Violations:**

- New platform functionality merged with no corresponding graph entry.

### graph-evidence

A constitutive rule's evidence must name the exact file or pattern a check would read to test it.

**Why:** Without a file or pattern to inspect, a checker cannot locate the evidence needed to test the rule.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** constitution

**Violations:**

- Evidence field left empty on a published constitutive rule.
- Evidence naming a directory or general area instead of a specific file or pattern a check reads.

**Files:**

- `constitution/constitutive/*.json`

### graph-violations

A rule's violations must each describe a detectable breach distinct from the rule's own criterion.

**Why:** A violation that mirrors the rule gives no additional signal for recognizing failure in practice, it's the same check written twice, once as an obligation and once as its reflection.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** constitution

**Violations:**

- A violation entry restates the rule's decision or criterion rather than naming a new failure mode.
- A violation entry describes a scenario indistinguishable from the rule passing.
- Two violation entries on the same node describe the same failure mode with different wording.

**Files:**

- `constitution/constitutive/*.json`
- `constitution/regulative-entity/*.json`
- `constitution/regulative-process/*.json`

### graph-why

A regulative rule's why must name the consequence of the rule's absence, not restate the decision or describe the rule's purpose in the abstract.

**Why:** A why that restates the decision gives no test for whether the rule is load-bearing, a rule can look justified while nothing would actually change if it were removed.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** constitution

**Violations:**

- Why restates the decision instead of naming what breaks without it.
- Why describes a benefit of the rule existing rather than a failure if it didn't.
- Why is generic enough to paste onto a different node unchanged.

**Files:**

- `constitution/regulative-entity/*.json`
- `constitution/regulative-process/*.json`

### job-function-scoped-roles

A role must define permissions by job function, not resource type, and be assigned to the application's Entra ID group, not an individual.

**Why:** Without job-function scoping, every new allowed resource type forces team re-onboarding.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** platform-member

**Violations:**

- Custom role with wildcard write permissions.
- Role scoped to a resource type rather than a job function.

**Files:**

- `platform-management/access-control/parameters/accessControl.bicepparam`
- `platform-management/access-control/bicep/modules/customRoleDefinitions.bicep`

### landing-zone-action-group

Alerts must route through the landing zone's action group, with recipients sourced from the platform member profile.

**Why:** Hardcoded contacts go stale, so alerts fire to former members and incidents go unanswered.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** landing-zone

**Violations:**

- Budget alert without an action group.
- Action group holding a hand-typed email address.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/base/actionGroup.bicep`
- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/base/budget.bicep`
- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/monitor.bicep`

### landing-zone-allowed-public-ip

Data-plane access from outside Azure must originate from the platform-trusted public IP.

**Why:** Without a trusted source address, application teams cannot reach Azure data-plane resources from their laptops.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** landing-zone

**Links:**

- depends-on → deployment-config-in-repo — Teams read the trusted IP from a committed platform variable.

**Violations:**

- Platform configuring PaaS firewall rules on behalf of the application team.
- IP address hardcoded in an application pipeline instead of read from the platform variable.

**Files:**

- `githubVariables.json`

### landing-zone-automation

Automation jobs must run inside the landing zone's own subscription.

**Why:** Without isolation, all landing zones would share a runtime the platform has no subscription to host.

**Anchor:** no-fixed-cost

**Implements:** landing-zone

**Links:**

- depends-on → platform-identity-graph — Jobs querying Entra ID require the landing zone identity's Graph read permissions.

**Violations:**

- Automation job running from a resource outside the landing zone subscription.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/landingzone-automation.bicep`
- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/base/jobs-cron.bicep`
- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/base/managedEnvironments.bicep`

### landing-zone-getting-started

An application repo must be seeded with deployable pipelines and modules from the template at creation.

**Why:** Without them, teams reverse-engineer platform patterns before they can deploy anything.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** platform-member

**Violations:**

- Module template customized for a specific application instead of generic.
- Application repo created without deployment pipelines.

**Files:**

- `.github/workflows/template-new-platform-members.yml`

### landing-zone-github-runners

A landing zone's pipelines must reach its data plane from inside the landing zone's own network.

**Why:** Public runners have no network path to the PaaS data plane once public access is denied.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** landing-zone

**Links:**

- depends-on → platform-identity-github — Runner registration authenticates through the platform GitHub App.

**Violations:**

- Application team using a separate VNet for runner integration.
- Runner label implying capability differences instead of network accessibility.
- Pipeline enabling public network access on a resource to reach it from a GitHub-hosted runner.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/base/virtualNetwork.bicep`
- `.github/scripts/create-landingzone-gh-runners.ps1`
- `.github/workflows/template-landing-zones.yml`

### landing-zone-identity

Every workflow, job, and service integration in a landing zone must act under one shared set of permissions.

**Why:** Without one shared permission set, every new capability multiplies the permission surface through RBAC and OIDC sprawl.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** landing-zone

**Links:**

- depends-on → landing-zone-repo — OIDC federation is scoped to the landing zone repo and environment.

**Violations:**

- Managed identity shared across multiple landing zones.
- Second identity introduced for a new capability.
- Role assignment granted to a system-assigned identity of a resource inside the landing zone.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/identity.bicep`
- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/base/appRoleAssignedTo.bicep`

### landing-zone-monitoring

Telemetry a landing zone produces must be stored, queried, and billed within that landing zone.

**Why:** A shared workspace merges ingestion costs across landing zones, which breaks the cost ownership model.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** landing-zone

**Links:**

- depends-on → azure-policy-config-diagnostic-settings — Azure Policy configures diagnostic settings that route telemetry to the landing-zone workspace.

**Violations:**

- Centralized Log Analytics workspace for general purpose logs.
- Diagnostic setting in a landing zone sending logs to a workspace in another subscription.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/monitor.bicep`
- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/base/logAnalyticsWorkspace.bicep`
- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/base/ActivityLogAlerts.bicep`

### landing-zone-repo

Every landing zone must be deployed and configured from its application's repository.

**Why:** Without a repo, the platform has no deployment mechanism and nowhere to write configuration for the application.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** platform-member

**Violations:**

- Bring-your-own-repo for landing zone creation.
- Landing zone configuration held outside the application repo.

**Files:**

- `.github/workflows/template-new-platform-members.yml`

### landing-zone-resource-group

Resources the landing zone template declares must live in a single dedicated resource group.

**Why:** Mixing template-managed and application-managed resources obscures which resources the landing zone template controls.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** landing-zone

**Violations:**

- A resource the template does not declare, deployed into the landing zone's dedicated resource group.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/bicep/main.bicep`

### landing-zone-tags

Tag values on a landing zone must be sourced from the platform member profile.

**Why:** Hand-typed tags drift from the member profile, so a resource stops showing who actually owns it.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** landing-zone

**Links:**

- depends-on → landing-zone-automation — Landing zone automation runs tag remediation.

**Violations:**

- Tag introduced that does not apply to all application landing zones.
- ownerEmail or engineerEmail hardcoded instead of read from the profile.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/azurePolicy.bicep`
- `landing-zones/managementGroup-AppName-environment.bicepparam`

### landing-zone-template

Each landing zone must have its own parameter file and its own trigger workflow.

**Why:** A shared trigger means acting on one landing zone risks redeploying another team.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** landing-zone

**Links:**

- depends-on → deployment-logic-reusable-workflow — Landing zone triggers call the shared deployment workflow.
- depends-on → platform-identity-azure — Template deployments authenticate as the platform Azure identity.

**Violations:**

- Generated workflow name lacks the lz-* prefix.
- One parameter file covering more than one landing zone.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/managementGroup-AppName-environment.bicepparam`
- `.github/workflows/template-lz-template.yml`
- `.github/workflows/requestNew-Landing-Zone.yml`

### oases-ipam

VNet address spaces must be allocated by querying live Azure, not by reading an assignment registry.

**Why:** Stale address allocations can produce overlapping VNet ranges that prevent peering.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** oases

**Violations:**

- VNet with a manually assigned address space.
- Allocation recorded in a registry file and trusted without a live check.

**Files:**

- `githubVariables.json`
- `.github/workflows/template-calculate-vnet-address-space.yml`
- `landing-zones/managementGroup-AppName-environment.bicepparam`

### oases-lifecycle

A landing zone must draw its subscription from the Subscription Bank, and must return it there when sunset rather than cancelling it.

**Why:** The Azure subscription limit counts cancelled subscriptions the same as active ones, so quota is not released by cancelling.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** oases

**Links:**

- depends-on → application-teams-own-the-cost — A reused subscription moves to the application's invoice section before provisioning completes.

**Violations:**

- Sunset subscription cancelled rather than returned to the bank.

**Files:**

- `.github/workflows/template-landing-zones.yml`
- `.github/workflows/template-destroy-landing-zone.yml`
- `githubVariables.json`

### oases-placement

The platform must not restrict landing zone placement to the production environment.

**Why:** Restricting landing zones to production prevents early adopters from testing features in the platform's test environment.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** oases

**Files:**

- `.github/workflows/requestNew-Landing-Zone.yml`

### platform-break-glass

Break-glass must be used only where automation cannot execute the change.

**Why:** An unrestricted role with no usage boundary becomes the fast path, and the repository stops being the record.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** platform

**Links:**

- depends-on → deployment-declarative-lifecycle — Break-glass access requires exclusion from stack deny assignments, which override role permissions.

**Files:**

- `platform-management/access-control/parameters/accessControl.bicepparam`
- `platform-management/access-control/bicep/accessControl.bicep`
- `.github/workflows/template-landing-zones.yml`

### platform-exemptions-automation

Platform automation Docker images must be hosted outside the landing zones.

**Why:** Without an external registry, each landing zone needs persistent image hosting, adding always-on cost before any workload exists.

**Anchor:** no-fixed-cost

**Implements:** platform

**Links:**

- constrains → azure-native-services-only — GitHub Container Registry is consumed outside ARM, not adopted as a platform service.

**Violations:**

- Automation image pulled from a registry the platform pays to host.
- Registry provisioned inside a landing zone to host platform images.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/landingzone-automation.bicep`
- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/base/jobs-cron.bicep`

### platform-identity-azure

Platform must use an Entra ID app registration as its identity

**Why:** BigBang must authenticate before it creates platform resources, so its identity cannot depend on those resources.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** platform

**Violations:**

- Platform deployment authenticates through a managed identity.
- Platform Azure identity is shared with non-platform workloads.

### platform-identity-claude

Agentic workflows must authenticate with the Claude Pro OAuth token.

**Why:** Without the token, every agentic workflow requires a paid API key.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** constitution

**Violations:**

- Agentic workflow step using ANTHROPIC_API_KEY instead of CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN.

### platform-identity-github

Platform and landing zone workflows must authenticate to GitHub through the platform GitHub identity.

**Why:** Without a shared GitHub App, the platform has no mechanism to provision and configure application repos and environments.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** platform

**Violations:**

- GITHUB_TOKEN used to write org-level variables or trigger other workflows.

**Files:**

- `githubVariables.json`
- `.github/workflows/template-landing-zones.yml`

### platform-identity-graph

A landing zone identity must hold granular Microsoft Graph read permissions and no broad directory access.

**Why:** Missing Graph read permissions break identity lookup; broad directory permissions expose more tenant data than applications need.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** platform

**Links:**

- depends-on → landing-zone-identity — Granting Graph permissions to the shared identity covers every landing zone workload.

**Violations:**

- Landing zone identity granted write permissions to Microsoft Graph.
- Landing zone identity granted Directory.Read.All instead of granular read permissions.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/bicep/entra.bicep`
- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/base/appRoleAssignedTo.bicep`

### self-service-policy-exemptions-defender-for-cloud

Defender for Cloud recommendations with no free remediation path must be pre-exempted by the platform.

**Why:** An unactionable recommendation left on the dashboard erodes confidence in the rest of the data.

**Anchor:** no-unapproved-resources

**Implements:** guardrail

**Violations:**

- Defender for Cloud exemption list containing a recommendation with a free remediation path.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/defenderForCloudExemptions.jsonc`
- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/azurePolicy.bicep`

### self-service-policy-exemptions

An exemption must be granted through a merged parameter-file PR or, for eight hours, through lz-flow-create-policy-exemption.

**Why:** Without a governed exemption path, blocked teams can bypass deny policies through untracked exceptions.

**Anchor:** no-unapproved-resources

**Implements:** guardrail

**Violations:**

- Exemption description that does not name the reason for the exemption.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/base/policyExemption.bicep`
- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/azurePolicy.bicep`
- `landing-zones/managementGroup-AppName-environment.bicepparam`

## Regulative - process

### add-automation-job

A new automation job must run as the landing zone identity, against the ARM API, from a publicly pullable image.

**Why:** A job needing its own identity, a data-plane path, or an authenticated base image cannot run unattended in every landing zone.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** landing-zone

**Trigger:**

- add automation job
- recurring platform task
- automate remediation

**Workflow:** platform-automation

**Steps:**

1. Read the governing rules.
2. Draft the job under landing-zones/automation/, using only ARM calls and no data-plane or VNet-dependent calls.
3. Draft a Dockerfile with a base image pullable without authentication.
4. Draft registration in landing-zones/bicep/modules/landingzone-automation.bicep, following the existing job pattern.
5. Present all proposed changes and wait for permission to implement.
6. Apply the approved changes.
7. Verify the job uses the landing zone identity without a separate identity or secret.

**Links:**

- governed-by → landing-zone-automation
- governed-by → platform-exemptions-automation
- governed-by → landing-zone-identity

**Violations:**

- Automation job authenticating with its own secret instead of the landing zone identity.
- Job image hosted in a registry requiring authentication.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/automation/`
- `landing-zones/bicep/modules/landingzone-automation.bicep`

### allow-resource-type

A resource type must clear deny coverage, diagnostic settings, and job-function role review before it joins the allowed list.

**Why:** A type listed ahead of its controls is available to every landing zone with nothing enforcing how it is configured.

**Anchor:** no-unapproved-resources

**Implements:** guardrail

**Trigger:**

- allow resource type
- approve resource type
- add resource to allowed list

**Workflow:** platform-Azure-Policy

**Steps:**

1. Read the governing rules.
2. Identify the built-in diagnostic-settings policy and draft its entry in diagnosticSettings.bicepparam.
3. Review each control in oases/ for built-in coverage with the required effect.
4. Draft custom definitions for uncovered controls and register them in policyDefinitions.bicepparam.
5. Review defenderForCloudExemptions.jsonc for resource-specific paid-SKU recommendations and accessControl.bicepparam for required job-function actions.
6. Once coverage and role review are complete, draft the allowedResources.json entry alongside all required control changes.
7. Present the complete draft and wait for permission to implement.
8. Apply the approved changes together.

### create-landing-zone

A landing zone must be provisioned through requestNew-Landing-Zone workflow.

**Why:** Provisioning outside the workflow leaves the subscription unaccounted for in the bank and off the application invoice section.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** landing-zone

**Trigger:**

- create landing zone
- provision environment
- new environment
- add azure subscription

**Workflow:** requestNew-Landing-Zone

**Steps:**

1. Collect the application name, environment (test or prod), management group (oases-prod or oases-test), and budget (default 100).
2. Verify the application file exists under platform-members/. If absent, complete register-platform-member before continuing.
3. Select a subscription from the bank with az account management-group subscription show-sub-under-mg --name subscription-bank --query "[0].name" -o tsv. Stop if none is returned.
4. Present all values, including the selected subscription ID, and wait for confirmation.
5. Dispatch requestNew-Landing-Zone, which opens a PR containing the parameter file and landing-zone workflow.
6. A platform engineer reviews the PR. Merge triggers the landing-zone workflow to provision the environment.

**Links:**

- depends-on → register-platform-member — Provisioning has no application to target until the member profile, group, and billing scope exist.
- governed-by → application-teams-own-the-cost
- governed-by → oases-ipam
- governed-by → oases-placement
- governed-by → landing-zone-template
- governed-by → deployment-branch-gated-promotion

**Violations:**

- Landing zone provisioned for an application with no platform member file.
- Subscription created new while the bank held an empty one.

**Files:**

- `platform-members/`
- `.github/workflows/requestNew-Landing-Zone.yml`

### deployment-branch-gated-promotion

A platform change must pass the test environment before it reaches production.

**Why:** Without an enforced gate, a single push can change production infrastructure with no prior validation.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** platform

**Links:**

- depends-on → platform-test-environment — The gate has no target to validate against without the test environment.

**Violations:**

- Workflow deploying to prod from a non-main branch.
- Production change with no corresponding test deployment.

**Files:**

- `.github/workflows/platform-Azure-Policy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/platform-access-control.yml`
- `.github/workflows/platform-Management-Groups.yml`
- `.github/workflows/platform-automation.yml`

### destroy-landing-zone

A landing zone must be decommissioned through lz-flow-destroy-landing-zone, which returns its subscription to the bank.

**Why:** Manual resource deletion does not return the subscription to the bank for reuse.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** landing-zone

**Trigger:**

- destroy landing zone
- decommission landing zone
- sunset environment

**Workflow:** lz-flow-destroy-landing-zone

**Steps:**

1. Read the governing rules.
2. Collect the subscription ID and locate its parameter file and landing-zone workflow. Stop if either is missing.
3. Present what decommissioning permanently removes: deployment stack, resource groups, role assignments, budget, and Defender settings. State that the subscription returns to the bank.
4. Wait for explicit confirmation, then dispatch lz-flow-destroy-landing-zone with the subscription ID.
5. Leave file deletion to the workflow, which opens a cleanup PR. A platform engineer reviews the PR; merge initiates Azure cleanup and returns the subscription to the bank.

**Links:**

- governed-by → deployment-declarative-lifecycle
- governed-by → application-teams-own-the-cost

**Violations:**

- Landing zone resources deleted by hand instead of through the workflow.
- Subscription cancelled rather than returned to the bank.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/oases-prod/`
- `.github/workflows/`

### knowledge-candidate

An observation that does not fit as a rule, a link, or a violation must be recorded as a knowledge-candidate issue rather than forced into the graph.

**Why:** Forcing an observation into a node shape produces an entry that passes review but gives no signal when the system drifts.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** constitution

**Trigger:**

- knowledge that doesn't fit the graph
- pattern across decisions
- explanatory context without a dependency

**Steps:**

1. Confirm the observation does not fit as a rule, a link, or a violation. If it does, update-knowledge-base is the process instead.
2. Draft the issue title and body. The title names the observation, and the body states the insight and references related entry ids.
3. Present the draft for confirmation.
4. Create the issue with the knowledge-candidate label.

**Links:**

- depends-on → update-knowledge-base — An observation reaches this path after that process establishes it does not fit the graph as an entry.

**Violations:**

- Issue created without confirmation.
- Observation recorded as a candidate when it is actually a missing rule or link.

### register-platform-member

An application must be registered through requestNew-Platform-Members before any landing zone is provisioned for it.

**Why:** Without the profile there is no Entra ID group, invoice section, or repo for a landing zone to attach to.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** platform-member

**Trigger:**

- register application
- new application team
- onboard team
- new team
- add application
- platform member
- join the platform

**Workflow:** requestNew-Platform-Members

**Steps:**

1. Collect the application name, owner email, and engineer email.
2. Present the values and wait for confirmation.
3. Dispatch requestNew-Platform-Members, which opens a PR creating platform-members/{AppName}.json.
4. A platform engineer reviews the PR. After merge, template-new-platform-members provisions the application repo, Entra group, billing scope, and repository variables.

**Violations:**

- Platform member file created by hand instead of through the workflow.

**Files:**

- `platform-members/`
- `.github/workflows/requestNew-Platform-Members.yml`

### update-knowledge-base

A knowledge graph entry must be drafted and presented before any file is written.

**Why:** An entry written without review enters the graph unchallenged, and the graph is what every later change is read against.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** constitution

**Trigger:**

- add a decision
- update a decision
- add an operation
- update an operation
- refine reasoning
- add a link
- update knowledge graph

**Steps:**

1. Identify whether the entry is new or existing. Read the existing file before drafting an update.
2. Choose the node type and follow its schema. Constitutive rules define what counts; regulative rules state requirements for entities or processes.
3. For individual rule files, match the ID to the filename and anchor the rule to a foundation. Constitutive subjects name vocabulary terms; regulative subjects specify entity or process.
4. For regulative rules, explain what fails without the requirement. Name the constitutive rules upheld in implements, or omit it when serving the foundation directly.
5. Add dependency links only where the source needs the target. Name the required constraint, fact, or output in the note; omit obvious relationships.
6. Present the complete draft and wait for permission to write.
7. Write the approved entry and regenerate constitution/graph.md with .github/scripts/write-knowledge-graph.ps1.
8. Open a pull request.

**Violations:**

- File written before a draft was presented.
- Link added in both directions between two entries.
- Violation that restates the rule instead of describing a detectable breach.
- A decision field combining two different concerns into one rule.

**Files:**

- `constitution/vocabulary/`
- `constitution/constitutive/`
- `constitution/regulative-entity/`
- `constitution/regulative-process/`

### update-landing-zone

Landing zone changes must use a merged parameter-file PR, except eight-hour exemptions granted through lz-flow-create-policy-exemption.

**Why:** Changes outside the parameter file or temporary-exemption workflow leave the landing zone's configuration untracked.

**Anchor:** no-platform-ops

**Implements:** landing-zone

**Trigger:**

- temporary policy exemption
- policy exclusion
- update budget
- cost alert

**Workflow:** lz-oasis-{appName}-{env}

**Steps:**

1. Read the governing rules.
2. Collect the application, environment, and requested change: cost, tags, or exemptions.
3. Locate the parameter file and its deployment workflow. If either is missing, stop the update and resolve provisioning through create-landing-zone.
4. For exemptions, ask whether the request is temporary or long-lived.
5. For a temporary exemption, collect the policy selection and subscription ID, present the eight-hour scope, and wait for confirmation. Dispatch lz-flow-create-policy-exemption and end this branch; no parameter-file edit or PR is required.
6. For cost, draft a change to the single budget value; additional alert thresholds are out of scope.
7. For tags, draft changes to subscriptionLevelTags and resourceLevelTags. Preserve ownerEmail and engineerEmail as readEnvironmentVariable references, with ownerEmail at subscription level.
8. For a long-lived exemption, draft an exemptions entry referencing a policy-assignment-reference.json key.
9. For parameter-file changes, present the complete draft and wait for permission to implement.
10. Apply the approved changes and open a PR. Merge redeploys the landing-zone stack with deleteAll.

**Links:**

- depends-on → create-landing-zone — There is no parameter file to edit until the landing zone has been provisioned.
- governed-by → azure-policy-reference
- governed-by → landing-zone-tags
- governed-by → deployment-declarative-lifecycle
- governed-by → self-service-policy-exemptions

**Violations:**

- Exemption entry naming a literal ARM assignment ID.

**Files:**

- `landing-zones/oases-prod/`
- `landing-zones/oases-test/`
- `.github/workflows/lz-flow-create-policy-exemption.yml`

### validate-codebase-rules

Every PR must be checked for rule violations and functionality absent from the graph; either finding must block merge.

**Why:** Without a blocking check, rule violations and unnamed functionality can reach the default branch.

**Anchor:** no-human-touch

**Implements:** constitution

**Trigger:**

- validate codebase rules
- pr rules check
- constitution validation

**Steps:**

1. Prerequisite: configure the check as required on the default branch, with no admin bypass.
2. On pull_request opened or synchronize, check out the PR head with full history.
3. Collect git diff origin/<base>...HEAD and the full content of non-deleted changed files. Exclude graph.md from injected content; cap injected content at 50 KB and mark truncation.
4. Run claude -p from the repository root so CLAUDE.md loads. Request a verdict for every foundation, constitutive rule, and regulative rule, including rules that do not apply.
5. Separately identify introduced functionality, capabilities, or resource types that no vocabulary, constitutive, or regulative node names.
6. Require JSON with result, summary: {what, why}, foundations, constitutive, regulative, and uncovered. Each uncovered entry must describe the gap and cite its introducing file and line.
7. Set the result to FAIL if any rule fails or uncovered is nonempty. A FAIL must fail the workflow job.
8. Render failures with violations and evidence, collapse passed rules by layer, and list uncovered findings separately.
9. Post the PR comment with the what/why summary, findings, model, token count, and cost in EUR.

**Links:**

- governed-by → functionality-named-in-graph

**Violations:**

- graph.md included in the injected file content.

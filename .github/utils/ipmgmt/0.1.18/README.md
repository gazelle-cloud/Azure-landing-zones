# Description

This repo is the ipmgmt module, which can be used to:

- Given a VNET range break it down to number of subnets based on a subnet size
- Given a list of IP ranges in use and  number of IP addresses needed find out a free slot for a VNET

In general it is a part of the project I run to show the process of creation Enterprise-focused PowerShell module, or set of modules for managing hybrid infrastructures in On-prem<->Azure environments.

# Knowledge Graph

Contains the reasoning behind how the platform is built. Holds authority over code.

## high level overiew

- Links are one-way. A note only knows what it points to, never what points back at it. The gap is bridged at consumption time by loading the full graph — so the data stays simple and the view stays complete.

- The more nodes that reference a decision, the more fully that decision is understood — through everything that depends on it, not through its own words.

- Every entry point opens a full picture of the system from its own point of view.
